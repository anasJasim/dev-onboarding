# Midient Todolist

Welcomet to the awesome Midient Todolist app. The app you will develop is the last missing step in human development. After this app, humanity can rest peacefully as our purpose will be fullfilled. Even if we go extinct, we need not worry as this app has accomplished our objective to the last!

However, the app at its current state is very messy (a repo of crap we may say). And you as a Midient Developer and Uncle Bob's disciple, follow the boy scout rule which says

```
Always leave the code you are editting a little better than you found it. - Robert Martin (Uncle Bob)
```

So you make it your lifes quest to take this Todolist app to its fullest.

## Starting your Journey to Enlightenment

Now you go take a look at the files and you don't see `.eslintrc`. "OMG, there is no linting config" you think to yourself! How can we enforce style and fix other problems without linting?!! If we work on this as a team and linting is not configured, the app will be one pile of inconsistent code!

### 1. Add Linting

For Javascript projects, the standard linter is called `ESlint`. `ESlint` can be configured per your needs. And we in Midient have already prepared our default configuration to make your life easy.

Install the required packages

```
yarn add --dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-config-google eslint-config-midient
```

Just as you are copy pasting the above command, Shaytan whispers in your ear "Leave it man, what are you concerning yourself with?! Linting??!! Are you kidding me?? Who has ever gotten anywhere because of lining??! Start doing some real shit!"

But haha Shaytan won't get to your enlightened mind! You immediately say to yourself "Investments made early in the beginning will amplify our returns later on" and think visually of the this graph;
